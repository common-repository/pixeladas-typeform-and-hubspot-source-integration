This plugin solves the problem of source tracking in hubspot where the Typeform forms are embedded in your website. 


== Description ==

This plugin solves the problem of source tracking in hubspot where the Typeform forms are embedded in your website. 
You only need to use a shortcode to insert a typeform in full size mode: 
`[pixeladas_typeform id="your form ID"/]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do we need to do some customizations in typeform? =

Yes, you need to activate the Hubspot connector, and activate two options. 
1. The source tracking 
2. The option "I want to embed this form"

= Why I need this plugin? =

Because the official Typeform plugin is not covering the embedded typeforms that need to be tracked in Hubspot.
